Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.

In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any exceptions like [ValueError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) or [ZeroDivisionError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError).

### Hints

* Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per - [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods), including split.
* Note that you can handle two exceptions separately with code like:
try:
  
    ...
except ValueError:
  
    ...
except ZeroDivisionError:
  
    ...

Or you can handle two exceptions together with code like:

try:

    ...
except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):

    ...

# Before You Begin
Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/), click on your terminal window, and execute cd by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

$

Next execute

$ mkdir fuel

to make a folder called fuel in your codespace.
Then execute

$ cd fuel

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as fuel/ $. You can now execute

$ code fuel.py

to make a file called fuel.py where you’ll write your program.

# How to Test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

* Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 3/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
75% 
* Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 1/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
25%
* Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 4/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
F
* Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 0/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
E
* Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 4/0 and press Enter. Your program should handle a [ZeroDivisionError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError) and prompt the user again.
* Run your program with python fuel.py. Type three/four and press Enter. Your program should handle a [ValueError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) and prompt the user again.
* Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 1.5/3 and press Enter. Your program should handle a [ValueError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) and prompt the user again.
* Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 5/4 and press Enter. Your program should prompt the user again.

You can execute the below to check your code using check50, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/fuel

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that check50 outputs to see the input check50 handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

# How to Submit

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.
